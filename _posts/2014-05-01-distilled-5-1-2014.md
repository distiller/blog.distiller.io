Welcome to the very first edition of Distilled, a collection of what
we at [Distiller](http://distiller.io) found interesting on the web,
and in the world, this week. We'll be publishing Distilled every
Thursday - let us know if you find a project or link you think would be
of interest to our
readers!

### CocoaConf San Jose

Over the weekend, we attended [CocoaConf San Jose](http://cocoaconf.com/sanjose-2014/home).
The conference was great and we'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking to connect with
other iOS developers and hone their craft in a friendly and collaborative environment. It
also happens to take place throughout the year in different locations.

Our goal was to get out and learn more about how iOS developers are dealing with building
and for that it was great. A solid community of developers who are all interested in
improving their processes and delivering better products to their customers. We learned a
ton.

As it happens, though, there was also great content. It was particularly exciting
to see the level of interest in bringing immutability and functional programming to iOS,
given our own tendency towards fp and our use of Clojure wherever we can fit it in.

And if you've never seen [James Dempsey and the Breakpoints]
(https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/james-dempsey-breakpoints/id533753679), you need to.

### f8

[f8](https://fbf8.com/) is obviously a pretty different conference.  Larger in scale in every
possible way. As former users of the fb platform API and current users of [Parse](http://parse.com),
it was interesting to hear the directions they are heading. On the platform side, we were also
consoling those who have bet their business on that ever-changing beast.

In terms of content, though, the interesting stuff was mostly in the "Hacker Way" sessions, where
Facebook engineers talked about how they build and deploy their own code. One known entity there is
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), which we are already using through [om](https://github.com/swannodette/om).
The mobile release engineering talk was also great. FB is doing things at an amazing scale, but they definitely
share our views about the value of Continuous Integration (and how nuts it can be for iOS).

As always, the community of people was great and we learned still more about how we can help. But we met some
developers who had traveled from Croatia just to be there. We probably wouldn't do that.

### Enlive Hacks

[Travis](http://github.com/travis) published two posts on some of ways
we're using [Enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive) to build
Distiller. Enlive is a templating library with a very different
philosophy from most templating libraries in use today. As with most
software, it makes some tasks easier and some harder - Travis posts on
two tasks that may seem non-trivial but are actually quite
straightforward -
[incorporating Markdown](http://hiim.tv/2014/04/28/enlive-templates-in-markdown/)
and
[using Google Analytics](http://hiim.tv/clojure/2014/05/01/google-analytics-with-enlive/).
