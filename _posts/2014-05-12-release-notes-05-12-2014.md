###Whatâ€™s new in this release.

**Improved Project Setup**

- Getting an iOS project actually set up can be a bit of a bear with workspaces, schemes, certificates, provisioning profiles, etc. We've simplified the process for new project setup substantially through the GitHub Search API to search your GitHub repository at setup to infer and pull out your configuration options. This dramatically reduces the effort necessary to get a new project going. Most projects can now be setup in just one or two minutes.

**More Dynamic UI to Reduce Reloads**

- We're leveraging our investment in Om [https://github.com/swannodette/om](https://github.com/swannodette/om) on the frontend to make the UI more dynamic and responsive to backend events. Things like build status, duration and logs are loading much smoother now.

**Logging Improvements**

- Errors that are generated due to incorrect project configuration are now being dumped into the logs for easier setup debugging.
