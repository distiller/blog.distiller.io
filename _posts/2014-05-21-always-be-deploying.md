title: Always Be Deploying. Introducing one-click deploys with Hockey App.
author: jim

Continuous Integration for iOS builds is great. What makes CI even better? Being able to deploy green builds to your testers in one-click. No engineering support required? Even better. Starting today, Distiller users can now deploy their builds via [Hockey App](http://hockeyapp.net/).

Our mission is to make the entire iOS build / test / deploy pipeline as automated and seamless as possible. Since launch, we’ve supported one-click deploys with Testflight. We’re huge fans of Hockey, and we’re excited to announce our support. 

So, head over and check out our [OTA Integration Guide](http://docs.distiller.io/start/getting_started_ota_deployment_setup/) to get started.
