It's that time again - here's what we found interesting this week.

### On the Web

- The [CocoaPods Trunk announcement](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Trunk/)
  looks like a positive step in the evolution of the community.

- [Mitchell Cohen](https://twitter.com/mitchchn) wrote a
  [great article](http://www.mitchchn.me/2014/os-x-terminal/) on eight
  OS X terminal utilities you definitely don't want to miss. `mdfind`
  and `screencapture` were new to us and we're gonna use them all the
  time.

- LogoLounge had an interesting roundup of
  [2014 logo trends](http://www.logolounge.com/article.asp?aid=lkSf) -
  if you're doing greenfield design work or just updating to a fresh
  look this will probably be useful.

- WWDC buzz is growing - let others know you're going
  [here](http://swinden.com/wwdc-2014-attendee-list/) and start
  planning party attendance [here](http://wwdcparties.com/).
