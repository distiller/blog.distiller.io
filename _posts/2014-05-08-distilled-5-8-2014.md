We've been cranking out Distiller improvements this week, but here are a few
things we found interesting:

### On the Web

- we announced [DIConfiguration](https://github.com/distiller/DIConfiguration),
  an Objective-C library for per-environment Xcode settings

- [Travis blogged](http://hiim.tv/clojure/2014/05/06/dateslop-three-ways/)
  about threading macros in Clojure, one of the many tools we use to
  keep the code that powers Distiller concise and readable

- [Cakebrew](https://www.cakebrew.com/) looks useful for anyone using
  homebrew to install development tools

### NSMeetup

Last night's [NSMeetup](http://www.meetup.com/nsmeetup) on
[Why it's Time to Go Beyond 'MVC' for Cocoa](http://www.meetup.com/nsmeetup/events/175364012/)
was great to see. It was a very pragmatic take on
[MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel), which seems to be coming up more and
more in iOS circles these days. Our read of the audience was that
[ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) (a toolkit often evaluated for
providing the bindings in MVVM) seems to be such a paradigm
shift for a lot of people that they are struggling to get their heads around it. Seeing
an MVVM implementation broken down into smaller steps using more familiar pieces probably
helped some of those folks see the value.

Also, shout out to whoever put up their hand and admitted to having a UIViewController with
4200+ lines of code.

More generally, if you're an iOS (or OSX) developer in the Bay Area and you're not attending
[NSMeetup](http://www.meetup.com/nsmeetup), you're missing out and probably reinventing a
wheel here or there. The subjects are thought-provoking and the people that attend have lots of
experiences to share.
