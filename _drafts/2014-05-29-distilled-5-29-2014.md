We're gearing up for WWDC next week, so here's our pre-WWDC edition of
Distilled - news and articles we found interesting this week.

### On the web

- [Beta](http://www.crashlytics.com/blog/launching-beta-by-crashlytics/)
  is a very interesting new OTA distribution service from the folks at
  (Crashlytics)[https://try.crashlytics.com/]. We'll be looking into
  pushing builds to Beta very soon.

- We started using [Sentry](https://www.getsentry.com/welcome/) this
  week. We're big fans of
  [minimizing the hard stuff](http://blog.distiller.io/2014/04/08/minimize-the-hard-stuff/)
  and error reporting is definitely hard. We're happy customers so far.

- Copy is important - [here's a great guide](http://www.gv.com/lib/5-principles-for-great-interface-copywriting) to make yours work.
