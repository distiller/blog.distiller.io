We're gearing up for WWDC next week, so here's our pre-WWDC edition of
Distilled - news and articles we found interesting this week.

### On the Web

- [Beta](http://www.crashlytics.com/blog/launching-beta-by-crashlytics/)
  is a very interesting new OTA distribution service from the folks at
  (Crashlytics)[https://try.crashlytics.com/]. We'll be looking into
  pushing builds to Beta very soon.

- We started using [Sentry](https://www.getsentry.com/welcome/) this
  week. We're big fans of
  [minimizing the hard stuff](http://blog.distiller.io/2014/04/08/minimize-the-hard-stuff/)
  and error reporting is definitely hard. We're happy customers so far.

- Copy is important - [here's a great guide](http://www.gv.com/lib/5-principles-for-great-interface-copywriting) to make yours work.

### CocoaKucha

- Last night was [CocoaKucha 4](http://www.meetup.com/CocoaPods-SF/events/180676392/).
  Our first time at one and it was a solid event. Really good crowd. Obviously, having
  almost the entire CocoaPods team in one place is compelling.

  We thought the format was awesome. Anything that didn't work perfectly in the auto-timed
  20s slide format actually led to the kind of humor that made everyone a little more relaxed.
  But truthfully, everything from [Delisa](https://twitter.com/kattrali)'s full-on stand-up
  routine on [Bad Cocoa](https://speakerdeck.com/kattrali/bad-cocoa) to
  [Leonard](https://twitter.com/speednoise)'s ridiculously informative
  [deep-dive on LLDB](http://speednoisemovement.com/lldb.pdf) seemed to benefit from
  the constraints.

  Great talks, great people, great format. And ... entertaining MCing by
  [Orta](https://twitter.com/orta). Awesome.
