We've been cranking out Distiller improvements this week, but here's
what we found interesting on the web.

- we announced [DIConfiguration](https://github.com/swannodette/om),
  an Objective-C library for per-environment Xcode settings

- [Travis blogged](http://hiim.tv/clojure/2014/05/06/dateslop-three-ways/)
  about threading macros in Clojure, one of the many tools we use to
  keep the code that powers Distiller concise and readable

- [https://www.cakebrew.com/](Cakebrew) looks useful for anyone using
  homebrew to install development tools
