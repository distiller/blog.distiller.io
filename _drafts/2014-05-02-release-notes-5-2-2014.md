###What’s new in this release.

**Web infrastructure:**
- We’ve moved the Distiller backend from Parse to Heroku. Look for an explanatory blog post coming soon. 
- We’ve standardized our frontend on Om. Om is a Clojurescript interface to Facebook’s React framework. We’ll cover the migration in another blog post. You can read about Om here: https://github.com/swannodette/om

**GitHub Commit Status Integration:**
- You can see the status of each commit on GitHub. Now you can see which pull requests are safe to merge right on the PR. Handy.

**Logging improvements:**
- Git messages are now visible.
- Cocoapod messages are also included in the logs.

**Build improvements:**
- We’re always trying to make the build experience less flaky.
