### On the Web

- [A Dark Room](https://medium.com/art-of-product-design/3dbf3958b514) is one of the coolest apps we've seen in a while - almost comically minimalist visual design, wickedly addictive game design

- [The Art of Error Messaging](http://inessential.com/2014/05/05/error_messages) provided a reminder that "[o]ne thing error messages never say is sorry" and offered other wisdom on good error message style

- Two podcasts featuring [David Nolen](http://swannodette.github.io/) and a fantastic blog post/demo exploring the ideas behind [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) got us even more excited about our decision to build [Distiller](http://distiller.io) around [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om): [Cognicast](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2014/04/10/david-nolen-cognicast-episode-054), [JavaScript Jabber](http://javascriptjabber.com/107-jsj-clojurescript-om-with-david-nolen/), [Removing User Interface Complexity, or Why React is Awesome](http://jlongster.com/Removing-User-Interface-Complexity,-or-Why-React-is-Awesome)

-  [This lightning talk](http://codon.com/the-dhh-problem) on DHH's role in the Ruby community was funny and provocative - a good reminder that one person's voice reflects only one person's experience, even if that person has as outsized an influence as DHH
