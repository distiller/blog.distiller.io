Unsurprisingly WWDC has made for a whirlwind of news, events, and
generally interesting stuff this week, and we've been eating it
up. Here are the highlights, as we see them, in this week's edition of
Distilled.

### On the web

* [The State of the Apple Developer Ecosystem](http://nikf.org/blog/the-state-of-the-ecosystem)
  is a long read that goes into interesting detail on where we're
  at. Apple obviously dropped a
  [ton of new developer tools](http://9to5mac.com/2014/06/02/apple-focuses-on-developer-features-for-ios-8-testflight-beta-testing-biggest-sdk-ever-inter-app-communication-and-more/)
  this week but just about everything from this post still holds true.

* [Swift.](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) Swift! SWIFT!! We're
  closet (ok not so closet) language nerds at Distiller and Swift left
  us drooling. A modern, functional language with some of the best
  features of Objective C, Scala, Ruby, Clojure, OCaml and more?
  Yes. Please.

* [This talk](http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm) from Maciej Ceg≈Çowski is
  a sobering take on some of the biggest problems with the web
  in 2014.  Not a pick-me-up, but necessary reading for anyone working
  on or around the web.
