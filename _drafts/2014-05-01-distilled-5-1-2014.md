Welcome to the very first edition of Distilled, a collection of what
we at [Distiller](http://distiller.io) found interesting on the web
this week. We'll be publishing Distilled every Thursday - let us know
if you find a project or link you think would be of interest to our
readers!

### F8

### CocoaDev

### Enlive Hacks

[Travis](http://github.com/travis) published two posts on some of ways
we're using [Enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive) to build
Distiller. Enlive is a templating library with a very different
philosophy from most templating libraries in use today. As with most
software, it makes some tasks easier and some harder - Travis posts on
two tasks that may seem non-trivial but are actually quite
straightforward -
[incorporating Markdown](http://hiim.tv/2014/04/28/enlive-templates-in-markdown/)
and
[using Google Analytics](http://hiim.tv/clojure/2014/05/01/google-analytics-with-enlive/).
